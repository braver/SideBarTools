# Sidebar Tools

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/braver/SideBarTools/master/screenshot.png" width="336">

Some useful tools to add to your sidebar context menu and command palette:

- Reveal In Sidebar
- Copy Filename
- Copy Relative Path
- Copy Absolute Path
- Copy Directory Path
- Duplicate

If you're missing the "Open With Default" command, consider fetching the
[Open in Default Application][5] package.

This package offers a subset of commands from the original 
[SidebarEnhancements][1], striking a balance somewhere between the bare minimum 
and the kitchen sink.

- The default context menu isn't replaced, this package just adds some useful 
  new commands.
- It's tiny, fast and reliable.
- We won't [track][2] you. Ever.
