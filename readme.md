# Sidebar Tools

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/braver/SideBarTools/master/screenshot.png" width="336">

Some useful tools to add to your sidebar context menu and command palette:

- copy filename
- copy path
- copy full path
- duplicate
- open in default program

This package offers a tiny optimised subset of commands from the original [SidebarEnhancements](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SideBarEnhancements), striking a balance somwhere between the bare minimum and the kitchen sink.

- The default context menu isn't replaced, this package just adds some useful new commands.
- It's tiny, fast and reliable.
- We won't [track](https://github.com/SideBarEnhancements-org/SideBarEnhancements/blob/d1c7fa4bac6a1f31ba177bc41ddd0ca902e43609/Stats.py) you. Ever.
